        At Help Scout, I contributed to several key projects that improved customer support tools for businesses worldwide.
      </p>

      <h2>Docs Team – Document Editor Implementation</h2>

      <p>
        I worked in developing the new document editor for Help Scout Docs, a platform that enables businesses to create and manage public or private documentation sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        This editor introduced significant improvements over the legacy system, addressing common customer pain points such as:

        <ul>
          <li>Real-time saving & data loss prevention</li>
          <li>Single-user editing with article locking showing view only for other users</li>
          <li>New rich-content features including code blocks, callouts, images, videos, and HTML blocks</li>
          <li>Seamless integration with Help Scout’s Mailbox product</li>
          <li>Onboarding for the new editor</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>AI Workstream – Enhancing AI in Customer Support</h2>

      <p>
        I was part of the AI Workstream team, focused on integrating artificial intelligence into Help Scout’s chat and email solutions.

      <p>
        Key contributions included:
        <ul>
          <li>AI Summary & AI Drafts for mail conversations</li>
          <li>AI-powered custom prompting for Help Scout customers</li>

            Innovative AI feature ideation, such as Docs Suggest – an AI-driven feature that recommends documentation improvements based on unanswered customer inquiries and poor feedback trends
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Frontend Modernization – Backbone to React Migration</h2>
